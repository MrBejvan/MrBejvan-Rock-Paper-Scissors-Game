# MrBejvan-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
# Simple text-based rock, paper, scissors game. My first repository on GitHub.

This was a project was used to clear the dust off of my C++ skills in preparation for my Data Structures class (Spring 2024). 
The project displays a simple main menu which takes user input and repeats via a while loop until the user quits in one of two ways. 
The program collects the user's selection (rock, paper, or scissors) and compares it to a randomly generated selection. The winner is determined according to the standard rock, paper, scissors rules and win counters and game counters are updated throughout the program's use.
